# Documented implementation decisions (per DEVPLAN P3.6 / ground rule 12)

Chronological log of judgment calls the plan left unspecified (or where a
cited mechanism did not cover the actual case), each bounded and applied
identically to every arm. The DEVPLAN references `runs/decisions.md`; `runs/`
is gitignored, so the committed log lives here.

## sprint-1 (data)

- **xView3 rasters arrive already in dB** (`VH_dB.tif`, float32, nodata
  −32768). The P1.3 sketch's `log10(clip(raw,1,None))` assumed linear
  amplitude; applying it would double-log. Chips store the product's dB
  values as float16, NaN for nodata. (chipper.py docstring)
- **Scene stratification variables come from the label CSV** (mean label
  lat/lon per scene as the region-bin input; shoreline = any label < 5 km).
  Avoids extracting 554 rasters to read georeferences; coarse 6-bin k-means
  is insensitive to the difference. (splits.py)
- **LS-SSDD internal split is a seeded 90/10 over all 9,000 sub-images**,
  not the dataset's official 6,000/3,000 benchmark partition: LS-SSDD is a
  pretraining source only (never evaluated), and the val side exists only
  for early stopping. (DEVPLAN BLOCKER-5 note; lsssdd_split pin docstring)

## sprint-3 (detector)

- **BigEarthNet stem adaptation 2→3 / 10→3**: timm's `adapt_input_conv`
  implements Repeat-with-rescaling only *from* 3-channel sources, so
  `repeat_with_rescaling` (init_loaders.py) generalizes the identical
  tile-and-rescale math (cyclic tile to target count, scale by src/dst).
  Note for a possible human-approved ablation: the S1 checkpoint's stem
  order is (VV, VH) while our input is (VH, VV, VH−VV) — blind tiling maps
  dst-VH ← src-VV etc.; a semantics-aware channel permutation is NOT applied
  because it would be an invented scheme (ground rule 12).
- **SatDINO**: pos_embed layout is `[cls, patches…, gsd_register]`; the
  trailing GSD-register position and the `gsd_register` parameter are
  dropped when loading into the vanilla timm ViT.
- **SARMAE**: `sar_encoder.*` ENCODER only (decoder_*, mask_token,
  optical_encoder.*, sar_alignment_ffn.* dropped).
- **Third-channel normalization**: frozen stats.json holds per-pol (VH, VV)
  stats; VH−VV is normalized with derived mean (µVH−µVV) and std
  √(σVH²+σVV²). The independence approximation only scales one channel by a
  constant shared by every arm — cannot become a between-arm confound.
  (datasets.py)
- **Intensity jitter ±1 dB** == the plan's "±0.1 in log space" (chips are
  dB = 10·log10). Applied before normalization. (transforms.py)
- **LS-SSDD single-channel stand-in**: sub-images are 8-bit single-pol JPGs;
  the fixed channel rep becomes [x, x, 0] (VH=VV=x ⇒ VH−VV=0), normalized by
  per-dataset train-split mean/std cached to `data/lsssdd_stats.json`.
  (datasets.py)
- **Frozen-scorer adapters live in infer_scene.py**: real CSVs use lowercase
  `source` values → normalized to 'Manual'/'AIS'/'AIS/Manual' when building
  GroundTruthPoints (the frozen scorer's dark test is `== "Manual"`);
  prediction-side `distance_from_shore_km` (needed for near-shore FP
  counting) is derived from the scene's 500 m bathymetry (land = elevation
  ≥ 0, euclidean distance transform in km).
- **Whole-scene inference reads each raster into RAM once** and slices
  512/384 windows from memory — per-window reads against striped compressed
  GeoTIFFs were ~100× slower and made the every-5-epoch dev eval unusable.
  The plan's 512/384 tiling and global-NMS decode are unchanged.
